# Front-End - Technical Task

Thanks for applying to work at Synspective. We have developed this small task for you to work on in your own time so that we can see how you approach solutions and as a discussion point going forwards.

Please implement the task with React and your choice of mapping library.

## The task

Using the Earthquake api data endpoint (it contains information about earthquake hazards), build a front end application that presents a list of Earthquake locations to the user and does the following:

- Displays a list of earthquakes with a summary (you can set a limit to the total amount shown).
- User can search earthquakes via date
- Plot the location of the Earthquake on a map

API end point: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/

Example request: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/query?format=geojson&starttime=2014-01-01&endtime=2014-01-02

Please create documentation for the steps required to run the project.
